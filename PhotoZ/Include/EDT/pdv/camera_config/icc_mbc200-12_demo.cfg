camera_model:                  "MBC200 Series (MBC2XX)"
camera_info:                   "12 bit - Display Demo Only"

# This configuration should be used to grab 12 of 14 bits for displaying data within the EDT software
# 12 bits - Data magnitude     Bits 0 - 11 
#  1 bit  - Sign               Bit 12       NOT USED
#  1 bit  - Bad pixel flag     Bit 13       NOT USED

# Note: The bad pixel bit is bit 15 at the camera, but wired to bit 13 of the grabber

# Note: After a calibration/normalization,
#       pixel data for targets warmer than the cal source will be values of 000  up  to FFF
#       pixel data for targets cooler than the cal source will be values of FFF down to 800

#       Therefore, slightly warmer targets will be black, while slightly cooler targets will be white.
#       For low contrast situations, the image will appear to be black and white, not grayscale, 
#       and inverted polarity (black hot, white cold).
