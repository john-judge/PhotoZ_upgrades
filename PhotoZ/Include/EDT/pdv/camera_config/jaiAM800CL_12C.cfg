# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):

# camera link config register bits
# (arg is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv lines if bit 4 is set, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines if bit 2 is also set, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes

# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_DATA_PATH_NORM) we need to
# set either htaps or vtaps to 2. Typcially it's htaps but depends on whether
# the two pixels that come out with each clock are both on the same line
# (uncomment htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2)

#htaps:	2
vtaps: 	2

# interlace / reorder method
# only for interleaved and some dual tap cameras
# determines how image is deinterleaved for display -- WORD_INTLV is only
# one of many available methods -- see *_INTLV in pdv_dependent.h and
# camera configuration guide for more
