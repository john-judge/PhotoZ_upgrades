# serial exposure (application/library hints)
#
# in mode 7 (overlap) use triggerIntTime (410) to control exposure
# IMPORTANT: in this mode the redlake has 0.001 to 10 second granularity,
# and takes that as a floating point a argument, whereas the
# shutter_speed_min/max values only allow integer values. so we're partly
# brain-dead as far as using pdv_set_exposure and exposure time sliders in
# pdvshow, etc. since we can only do 1-10 seconds in this mode. Nevertheless,
# this gets us going in the right direction.

# camera link data path register bits (hex):
# 0-3: number of bits per pixel - 1
# 4-7: number of channels - 1
# (this camera's dual channel is internal to the camera only

# camera link config register bits (hex):
# 0: RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)

# 2: line scan
# 3: disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4: unused
# 5: data valid invert (rare)

CL_CFG_NORM:		00

# mode control register bits (hex):
# 0-3: on/off state of mode control lines
# 4-7: which mode control line to send expose pulse for
#      triggered exposure or pulse-width triggering.
# this directive is usually set to 00 for free-running cameras,

# as of v4.1.3.6 and later, pclock_speed (camera pixel clock speed)
# can be put in configs and will be used by the library to bias the auto
# timeout to a more reasonable value; very handy for large format
# cameras to avoid really long timeout waits. also can be used for
# application hints (app can access it at it as dd_p->pclock_speed)

# FMRATE_ENABLE tells it to send continuous pulses at frame_period intervals
# -- to get true overlap the app will need to call pdv_set_frame_period()
# every time exposure changes and have the frame period be just the right
# amount to overlap with the given exposure time
#
method_frame_timing: FMRATE_ENABLE
frame_period: 110000

# for FMRATE_ENABLE we still need to fake out hw to not send a trigger
# on every acquire; this is how it's done. possibly put make this auto
# with FMRATE_ENABLE in initcam in the future but this does work.
