# serial on this guy is a little different -- faster baud rate,
# plus single-char ASCII commands with no terminating CR but some
# follow-on responses to commands that do take a CR (interactive
# model) so best to just use hex

# send serial commands to camera to init to expected state.
# The OWL serial command format is Command<CR> value<CR>.
# in the absence of a serial-term indicating otherwise,
# serial_init will send a <CR> after every colon-separated
# command in the list. Per Fairchild's doc, the command to set
# freerun is SSM<CR> 1<CR>. Therefore....

# or pulse-width cameras/modes
