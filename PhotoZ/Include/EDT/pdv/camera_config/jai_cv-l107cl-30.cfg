# mode bitfile loaded, as follows (See "Firmware" section of the Users Guide
# for details on checking and loading firmware ):
# - PCI DV C-Link: pdvcamlk_pir (medium)
# - PCIe4 DV C-Link: pe4dvcamlk32_mmrgb (medium RGB)
# - PCIe8 DV C-Link: pedvcamlk or pe8dvcamlk2 (base+medium)
# - Other: contact EDT

# (argument is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL (or VACTV lines -- see bit 0x10 )
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): if 04 also set, gen. an FVAL after every vactv lines (for line scan)
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
