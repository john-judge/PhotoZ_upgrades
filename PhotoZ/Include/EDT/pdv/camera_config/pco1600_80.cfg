# PCO.1600
#
# Basic config for the PCO 1600 camera, in continuous output mode.
# The PCO 1600 is fairly dependent the PCO software and supported framegrabbers
# which to date (7/11/2007) have not been fully integrated with the PCI DV.
# The EDT serial DLL does work with their sc2_clser_control.exe camera control
# app under Windows, but not other PCO applications.  Therefore, except for
# programmers who is experienced with calera-FG integration issues, full
# functionality of the camera is somewhat limited, especially on non-Windows
# platforms. That being said this config will get you going in freerun mode,
# and if on Windows you will be able to change use the aforementioned serial
# app to configure the camera's gain, exposure time. etc. Work is ongoing to
# fully integrate EDT boards with PCO cameras.

# the following directives can be used to send us any serial commands
# necessary to put the camera to put it into the expected state.
# serial_init takes a colon-separated list of ASCII commands, and should
# be used for cameras that use an ASCII serial command set. serial_binit
# takes a space-separated list of hex bytes, for cameras that use binary
# serial instead of ASCII.  Examples of commands that should be sent
# include those that put the camera into the desired trigger mode (e.g.
# continuous, triggered, controlled). Be sure to also configure the board
# for the matching mode, via MODE_CNTL_NORM and
# method_camera_shutter_timing.

# Shutter timing method:

# Mode Control register (hex)
# Hex value -- the left-most nibble determines which CC line is toggled for
# the EXPOSE pulse (if method_camera_shutter_timing is other than AIA_SERIAL).
# The right-most nibble determines which of the CC lines are held permanently
# high or low.  Typically this is set automatically by merthod_camera_timing
# (to 10 hex for triggered and MCL modes, 00 otherwise).  However if your
# camera needs it set otherwise, use this directive to do so.
