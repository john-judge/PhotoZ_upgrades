# the following directives can be used to send us any serial commands
# necessary to put the camera to put it into the expected state.
# serial_init takes a colon-separated list of ASCII commands, and should
# be used for cameras that use an ASCII serial command set. serial_binit
# takes a space-separated list of hex bytes, for cameras that use binary
# serial instead of ASCII.  Examples of commands that should be sent
# include those that put the camera into the desired trigger mode (e.g.
# continuous, triggered, controlled). Be sure to also configure the board
# for the matching mode, via MODE_CNTL_NORM and
# method_camera_shutter_timing.

# serial_term defines the termination character(s) that will be sent after each
# serial command sent by the library subroutine pdv_serial_command, including
# those sent by serial_init (above).  If no serial_term is specified, the
# default, carriage return character (0d hex) will be sent. If some other
# sequence is needed, uncomment serial_term and insert the appropriate hex
# byte(s) separated by spaces.  serial_term only applies to EDT's ASCII-specific
# serial directives (e.g. serial_init) and library subroutines (pdv_serial_command),
# NOT binary ones (serial_binit, pdv_serial_binary_command).  To specify no
# serial terminator, call serial_term with an empty list <>

# shutter timing method. For continuous or triggered cameras, this should be left
# commented out or set to AIA_SERIAL, For controlled, or 'pulse-width' mode, where
# the board's shutter timer controls the exposure, set to AIA_MCL. These are the
# most common methods but not all -- see the manual for more methods.  Also look
# at the shutter_speed_min/max and serial_exposure directives in the camera
# configuration guide.
# NEW FEATURE as of pdvlib version 3.3.3.4 -- if MODE_CNTL_NORM is NOT set
# explicitly, it will be set to appropriate default  based on value of method_
# camera_shutter_timing. Likewise shutter_speed_min/max will be set to min/max
# board shutter timing values (0 and 25500) IF one of the MCL modes is set. So
# for many conditions, method_camera_shutter_timing is all that is needed.
