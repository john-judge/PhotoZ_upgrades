# vskip/hskip is how many pixels to skip before ROI, vert and horiz
# vactv/hactv is how many pixels to DMA to memory after skip, vert and horiz
# if full frame is desired, you can leave these commented out or make them the
# same as the camera width/height. hskip/hactv can also be used to trim columns
# for cameras that output non-4-byte-aligned data to multiple of 4 bytes (in
# width) to ensure proper operation of windows applications that depend on
# 4-byte alignment, e.g. pdvshow

#hskip: 0
#hactv: 640
#vskip: 0
#vactv: 480

# camera link data path register bits:
# 0-3: number of bits per pixel - 1

# camera link config register bits:
# 0: RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)
# 1: ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2: line scan
# 3: disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4: unused
# 5: data valid invert (rare)
# 6-7: undefined

CL_CFG_NORM:                   02

# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_DATA_PATH_NORM) we need to set
# either htaps or vtaps to 2. Which one depends on whether the two pixels
# that come out with each clock are both on the same line (uncomment
# htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2) 
#
htaps:	2
#vtaps: 2

# one of many available methods -- see *_INTLV in pdv_dependent.h and
# camera configuration guide for more
