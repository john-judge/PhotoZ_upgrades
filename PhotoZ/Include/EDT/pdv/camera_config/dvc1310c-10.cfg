# shift and mask not sepecified -- added auto set of shift in
# initcam # for this case since it would different for pci
# dv/dvk versus pcidv44 (0 for the former, 16 for the latter).
# also auto sets mask if not set either

# hskip changed to 5 -- cuts off some of the left black border, and odd
# number since the inverted clock (see rbtfile) results in a horizontal
# pixel shift which would throw off any color interpolation
# vskip changed to 2 to cut off top black border
