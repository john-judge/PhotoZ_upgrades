# region of interest start and area - REQUIRED for this camera with 
# newer (e.g. visionlink) EDT boards. This clips off the black borders
# on the UP685 and also yields a 16-byte divisible framesize. Full UP685
# frame is 692x501, however current EDT boards require 16-byte divisible
# framesize. If you want more of the frame, adjust the ROI accordingly
# but maintain a framesize that meets that requirement.
