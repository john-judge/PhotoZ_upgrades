# interlace method
# see camera configuration guide for more methods
# using xregwrite to force interlace bit (and EXTDEPTH) in datapath
# register -- should be done with interlace: 1 but this turns out to
# be incompatible with swinterlace methods in pdv_interlace
# -- don't forget to set this to 01 (turn off EXTDEPTH) if 8-bit

# serial_baud/mode -- mode RS232 sets HW register to match RS232 jumpers
# on the board -- MAKE SURE PCI DVA OR PCI DVFOX BOARD JUMPERS ARE SET

# serial_binit can be used to send us any serial commands to put
# the camera into a known state matching this board config.
# this config matches power-up for this camera so none are necessary
# but can be used if needed. Note that DRS wants checksum in last byte
# (not too clear from the documentation) so for example the FIRMWARE
# VERSION command would be 01 07 00 f8 f6, or by serial_binit:
#
#serial_binit "01 07 00 F8 F6"
