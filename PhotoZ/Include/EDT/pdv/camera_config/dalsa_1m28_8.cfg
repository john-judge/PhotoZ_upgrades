# This is a generic camera configuration file, intended as a starting 
# place for creating a file for a new camera.  See the PCI DV User's
# guide for directions and configuration file parameter descriptions.
# Unmodified, this file should work for a single-channel Camera-Link
# camera that outputs data continuously (no trigger required) in
# 1024x1024, 10-bits per pixel with the LSB on VD0 or MSB0.
#

# camera description, for camera selection GUI and apps
# camera_class should be the manufacturer's name
