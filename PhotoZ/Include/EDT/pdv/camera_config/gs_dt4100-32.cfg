# region of interest:
# NOTE: on the evaluation camera that EDT tested, first line has an initial
# short line valid resulting in a partial first line and shifted image.
# Region of interest used to skip first line fixes it but this should
# probably be fixed in the camera in order to capture all 1080 lines
