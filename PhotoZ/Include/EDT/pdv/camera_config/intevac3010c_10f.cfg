# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #taps
# bits 0-3: number of bits per pixel minus 1
# bits 4-7: number of taps minus 1

CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             09	# single tap 10 bit

# camera link config register bits
# (arg is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
#
CL_CFG_NORM:                   02

# htaps/vtaps: if multiple taps, set either htaps or vtaps to match the number
# of taps and whether they represent horizontal or vertical. Most common it's
# htaps (that is, pixels in parallel taps are from pixels next to each other on
# the same line) For example with a 2-tap 8-bit camera (CL_DATA_PATH_NORM: 17)
# where the two taps are from adjacent pixels on the same line, you would uncomment
# htaps and leave it at 2.
#
htaps:	1

# DVFOX fiber-optic boards with RCX C-Link defaults to 24-bit packing across the
# fiber. For most cameras that's optimal, however for 10-16 bit cameras with pixel
# clock rates above 40 and up to 60Mhz, OR serial rates > 19.2kbaud, we need to
# use 16 bit mode. Un-commenting this directive will do that if you're using a
# FOX board. If you're using a non-fiber board such as the PCI DV C-Link or
# PCIe8 DV C-link, this flag is ignored.

# Region of Interest start and area (decimal)
# vskip/hskip is how many pixels to skip before ROI, vert and horiz
# vactv/hactv is how many pixels to DMA to memory after skip, vert and horiz
# if full frame is desired, you can leave these commented out or make them the
# same as the camera width/height. hskip/hactv can also be used to trim columns
# for cameras that output non-4-byte-aligned data to multiple of 4 bytes (in
# width) to ensure proper operation of windows applications that depend on
# 4-byte alignment, e.g. pdvshow
