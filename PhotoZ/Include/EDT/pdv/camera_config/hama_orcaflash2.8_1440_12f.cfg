# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #taps
# bits 0-3: number of bits per pixel minus 1
# bits 4-7: number of taps minus 1
#
CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:              1b	# dual tap

# camera link config register bits
# (arg is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv lines if bit 4 is set, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines if bit 2 is also set, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
#
CL_CFG_NORM:                   02

# htaps/vtaps: if multiple taps, set either htaps or vtaps to match the number
# of taps and whether they represent horizontal or vertical. Most common it's
# htaps (that is, pixels in parallel taps are from pixels next to each other on
# the same line) For example with a 2-tap 8-bit camera (CL_DATA_PATH_NORM: 17)
# where the two taps are from adjacent pixels on the same line, you would uncomment
# htaps and leave it at 2.
#
htaps:		2
#vtaps:		2

# interlace method
# WORD_INTLV_MIDTOP_LINE is 10-16-bit line interleave, middle line iterating up
# to the top followed by middle+1 iterating down to the bottom -- see Hamamatsu
# OrcaFlash documentation for details
#
method_interlace:	WORD_INTLV_MIDTOP_LINE

# send serial commands on init to set the hamamatsu into the expected mode

serial_init: "AMD N:SMD N:ACT I:PEC O"

# Serial wait character
# The pdv_serial_wait() subroutine in EDT API normally waits for a fixed period
# of time before returning, to make sure it has received all of the characters
# in a given respnse. If the camera has a unique character that terminates every
# response, serial_waitc can be used to tell pdv_serial_wait to return immediately
# when that character is seen, speeding up serial initialization and the serial
# command/response sequence in general. The argument to this directive is hexidecimal
# value; therefore if the last character of every response is a newline, specify 0a ;
# if it is a carriage return, specify 0d and so on.

#Serial baud rate

# Shutter timing method:
#   set to AIA_SERIAL (or leave out) for freerun cameras
#   set to AIA_TRIG for triggered 
#   set to AIA_MCL for pulse-width triggered -- that is, the duration of the
#     TRUE pulse determines the exposure time, range 1-25500 milliseconds
#   set to AIA_MCL_100US for pulse-width with a range of 1-25500 microseconds
#
# Related directives are shutter_speed_min/max and serial_exposure directives
# -- see the camera configuration guide.

#method_camera_shutter_timing: AIA_SERIAL
#method_camera_shutter_timing: AIA_TRIG
#method_camera_shutter_timing: AIA_MCL
#method_camera_shutter_timing: AIA_MCL_100US

# Mode Control register (hex)
# Hex value -- the left-most nibble determines which CC line is toggled for
# the EXPOSE pulse (if method_camera_shutter_timing is other than AIA_SERIAL).
# The right-most nibble determines which of the CC lines are held permanently
# high or low.  Typically this is set automatically by merthod_camera_timing
# (to 10 hex for triggered and MCL modes, 00 otherwise).  However if your
# camera needs it set otherwise, use this directive to do so.

# MODE_CNTL_NORM: 10

# DVFOX fiber-optic boards with RCX C-Link defaults to 24-bit packing across the
# fiber. For most cameras that's optimal, however for 10-16 bit cameras with pixel
# clock rates above 40 and up to 60Mhz, OR serial rates > 19.2kbaud, we need to
# use 16 bit mode. Un-commenting this directive will do that if you're using a
# FOX board. If you're using a non-fiber board such as the PCI DV C-Link or
# PCIe8 DV C-link, this flag is ignored.

#mode16: 1

# Region of Interest start and area (decimal)
# vskip/hskip is how many pixels to skip before ROI, vert and horiz
# vactv/hactv is how many pixels to DMA to memory after skip, vert and horiz
# if full frame is desired, you can leave these commented out or make them the
# same as the camera width/height. hskip/hactv can also be used to trim columns
# for cameras that output non-4-byte-aligned data to multiple of 4 bytes (in
# width) to ensure proper operation of windows applications that depend on
# 4-byte alignment, e.g. pdvshow
