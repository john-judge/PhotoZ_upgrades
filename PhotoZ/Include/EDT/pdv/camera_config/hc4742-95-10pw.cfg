# the following apply to RS-422 serial controlled cameras only.
# serial_init defines a series of commands to be sent to the camera when
# initcam is run (and on boot). serial_exposure, gain and offset define
# which serial commands will be used by the pdv_set_exposure, pdv_set_gain,
# and pdv_set_offset convenience functions, which are used by EDTs example
# programs.  The values given are a "sample" set-up. Programmers may wish
# to change some of these, particularly serial_init, to suit specific needs.
# or just use pdv_serial_command in the program to override these settings.
