# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #taps

# bits 4-7: number of taps minus 1

# camera link config register bits
# (argument is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv lines if bit 4 is set, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines if bit 2 is also set, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
#
CL_CFG_NORM:                   00

# htaps/vtaps: if multiple taps, set either htaps or vtaps to match the number
# of taps and whether they represent horizontal or vertical. Most common it's
# htaps (that is, pixels in parallel taps are from pixels next to each other on
# the same line) For example with a 2-tap 8-bit camera (CL_DATA_PATH_NORM: 17)
# where the two taps are from adjacent pixels on the same line, you would uncomment
# htaps and leave it at 2.
#
htaps: 5
#vtaps: 5

# PCO serial commands
#
# all commands are hex bytes, but sent LSB to MSB which is reversed from PCO's
# documentation.
#
# for instance, the "start output" command below is shown in PCO's documentation as follows:
#     COMMAND  LENGTH  DATA  CHKSUM
#     0614     0007    0001  22
#
# the command going out our board is transmitted as:
#     COMMAND  LENGTH  DATA  CHKSUM
#     1406     0700    0100  22
#
# COMMAND = group code, message code
# LENGTH = length of complete message including the checksum byte
# DATA = data needed to execute command (set specific parameter)
# CHKSUM = checksum byte, calculated as sum of all previous bytes 
#
# Use serial_binit string below this block for the following settings:
# CMND LENG DATA                 CHKSUM  DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND

# Mode Control register (hex)
# Hex value -- the left-most nibble determines which CC line is toggled for
# the EXPOSE pulse (if method_camera_shutter_timing is other than AIA_SERIAL).
# The right-most nibble determines which of the CC lines are held permanently
# high or low.  Typically this is set automatically by merthod_camera_timing
# (to 10 hex for triggered and MCL modes, 00 otherwise).  However if your
# camera needs it set otherwise, use this directive to do so.

# MODE_CNTL_NORM: 10

# Region of Interest start and area (decimal)
# vskip/hskip is how many pixels to skip before ROI, vert and horiz
# vactv/hactv is how many pixels to DMA to memory after skip, vert and horiz
# if full frame is desired, you can leave these commented out or make them the
# same as the camera width/height. hskip/hactv can also be used to trim columns
# for cameras that output non-4-byte-aligned data to multiple of 4 bytes (in
# width) to ensure proper operation of windows applications that depend on
# 4-byte alignment, e.g. pdvshow
