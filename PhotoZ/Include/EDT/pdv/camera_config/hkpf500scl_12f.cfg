# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_DATA_PATH_NORM) we need to
# set either htaps or vtaps to 2. Typcially it's htaps but depends on whether
# the two pixels that come out with each clock are both on the same line
# (uncomment htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2)

htaps:	2

# interlace method
# only for interleaved and some dual channel cameras

# the following directives can be used to send us any serial commands
# necessary to put the camera to put it into the expected state.
# serial_init takes a colon-separated list of ASCII commands, and should
# be used for cameras that use an ASCII serial command set. serial_binit
# takes space-separated groups of hex bytes, for cameras that use binary
# serial instead of ASCII; each group gets send as a separate command with
# a serial_read of the response (thrown away) between each.  Examples of
# commands that should be sent include those that put the camera into the
# desired trigger mode (e.g. continuous, triggered, controlled), #bits and
# channels, etc. The idea is to set the camera mode to match how the rest
# of the config directives are setting up the FG board.

# Serial termination Character
# defines the termination character(s) that will be sent after each
# serial command sent by the library subroutine pdv_serial_command, including
# those sent by serial_init (above).  If no serial_term is specified, the
# default, carriage return character (0d hex) will be sent. If some other
# sequence is needed, uncomment serial_term and insert the appropriate hex
# byte(s) separated by spaces.  serial_term only applies to EDT's
# ASCII-specific serial directives (e.g. serial_init) and library subroutines
# (pdv_serial_command),
# NOT binary ones (serial_binit, pdv_serial_binary_command).  To specify no
# serial terminator, call serial_term with an empty list <>

# Shutter timing method:
#   set to AIA_SERIAL (or leave out) for freerun cameras
#   set to AIA_TRIG for triggered 
#   set to AIA_MCL for pulse-width triggered -- that is, the duration of the
#     TRUE pulse determines the exposure time, range 1-25500 milliseconds
#   set to AIA_MCL_100US for pulse-width with a range of 1-25500 microseconds
#
# Related directives are shutter_speed_min/max and serial_exposure directives
# -- see the camera configuration guide.

# Mode Control register (hex)
# Hex value -- the left-most nibble determines which CC line is toggled for
# the EXPOSE pulse (if method_camera_shutter_timing is other than AIA_SERIAL).
# The right-most nibble determines which of the CC lines are held permanently
# high or low.  Typically this is set automatically by merthod_camera_timing
# (to 10 hex for triggered and MCL modes, 00 otherwise).  However if your
# camera needs it set otherwise, use this directive to do so.
