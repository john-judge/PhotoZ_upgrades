# Bit# Hex  Description
#  0  (01): RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)
#  1  (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
#  2  (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv (if 10 is set), for linescan

#  4  (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv (height) lines, for linescan
#  5  (20): data valid invert (rare)
#  6  (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
#  7  (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
