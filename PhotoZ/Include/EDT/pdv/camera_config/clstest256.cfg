# clstest256.cfg
#
# EDT config file for use testing tiff image send / receive 
# with EDT CLS series camera simulator boards and supplied tiff images
# in tiffs256 directory. Package includes imagelist with these images listed
#
# This config is intended to for use with EDT tools to do a quick test
# of EDT CLS DMA output and optionally input to EDT DV series framegrabber
# board. The package as installed includes the directory "tiffs256" and 10
# tiff images: num0.tif, num1.tif, ... num9.tif. The supplied "imagelist" lists
# these images for use by send_tiffs, or use simple_clsend which just takes the
# directory the images are in as an argument. Assuming an EDT framegrabber enumerated
# as unit 0 and the EDT simulator as unit 1, an example command-line test would be as
# follows:
# 
#  initcam -u 0 -f camera_config/clstest256.cfg    (initialize the EDT FG board)
#  clsiminit -u 1 -f camera_config/clstest256.cfg  (initialize the EDT simulator board)
#  send_tiffs -u 1 imagelist -l 0                  (send all imgs listed in imagelist repeatedly)
#    OR
#  simple_clsend -u 1 -m -l 0 clstest256           (send all images in clstest256 dir repeatedly)
#
#  (in another window:)
#  take -u 0 -N 4 -l 100                           (grab 100 images and make sure no timeouts)
#    OR
#  pdvshow -pdv0                                   (use pdvshow to capture and view images)
#
# for more about the above applications / examples, see the source code for each, or run
# <appname> --help for usage.
#
# Note: in the above example, the framegrabber is unit 0, simulator is unit
# 1; use pciload to see how the system enumerated the devices in your system and
# adust the -u and -pdvN arguments accordingly.
