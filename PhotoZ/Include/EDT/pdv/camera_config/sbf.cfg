# calculate col/frame and ticks/line with 575 x 520
# colunms = 576/8 = 72 = 0x48
# rows = 520/4 = 130 = 0x82
# 
# cycle power on camera after running initcam 
# reason: our drivers and receivers are turned off while xilinx
# is loading, and the camera runs continuously. there is cross talk
# from data, pclk, fv, lv to serial lines back to camera, resulting
# in no response from camera.
