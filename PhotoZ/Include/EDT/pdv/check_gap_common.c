 * check_gap.c
 *
 * This program performs continuous input from edt dma device
 * and optionally reads in different size of memory buffer.
 * The program keeps track of the number of gaps from the input
 * and the result of throughput is printed out with the table
 * of frequency.
 *
 * check_gap should work with the following cards: PCDa, PCD SS,
 * and PDV Camera Link.  Normally people will not have multiple
 * different types of boards in their system, so this program will 
 * use the default board type (EDT_INTERFACE). Actually, that will
 * only let us distinguish between pdv (for CL) and pcd (SS and PCD).
 * So, what we do is open(EDT_INTERFACE,unit) and check what exactly
 * it is (with edt_p->devid). 
 *
 * This program determines *exactly* which board it 
 * is using by comparing the edt_p->devid to PCDA_ID, PSS4_ID, and 
 * PDVCL_ID.
 
 * Of course, that *still* doesn't allow
 * us to completely know what we're dealing with. The SS boards
 * can be loaded with a 16, 4, or 1 channel bitfile and we can tell
 * a 16 channel from its devid, but the 4 and 1 channel report 
 * themselves as PSS4_ID.  Due to this, this program assumes the
 * board is 4 channel if it is a PSS4_ID, and the user is required
 * to specify otherwise (if it is indeed the 1 channel)  by using
 * the --ss1 option.
 *
 * INPUT: check_gap -l <loop_size> or check_gap -F <clock_speed>
 *
 * TODO: 1) see other todo's in this code
 *      2) look over code & remove as much board specific code as
 *      possible (make code as general as possible).
 *      3) test
