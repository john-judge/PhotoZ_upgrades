* @file 
* PCI DV Library, most subroutines.
*
* @defgroup dv EDT Digital Imaging Library
*
* The PCI DV digital imaging library provides a C language interface to the PCI DV
* device driver, including routines for image capture, save, and device control.
*
* The PCI DV library sits on top of the lower-level \ref dma. Library functions from
* both libraries operate on the same device handle, and both types of routines can be
* used in the same application. However PCI DV (<code>pdv_</code>) library subroutines are designed to
* handle the extra bookeeping, error-recovery, triggering and timing functionality
* that is present on EDT Digital Imaging boards. Direct calls to the EDT DMA (<code>edt_</code>)
* Library routines should only be made when there is functionality needed that is
* not provided by the Digital Imaging library.  (Note: this restriction does not apply to the
* \ref msg.)
*
* All routines access a specific device whose handle is created and returned by
* the #pdv_open or #pdv_open_channel routine. PCI DV applications typically include the
* following elements:
*  -# The preprocessor statement:
*  @code
*  #include "edtinc.h"
*  @endcode
*  -# A call to #pdv_open or #pdv_open_channel, such as:
*  @code
* PdvDev *pdv_p = pdv_open(EDT_INTERFACE, 0);
*  @endcode
*   (EDT_INTERFACE is defined as \c "pdv" in edtdef.h.)
*  -# Device control or status calls, such as #pdv_get_height, as in:
*  @code
* int height = pdv_get_height(pdv_p);
*  @endcode
*  -# Ring buffer initialization code, such as:
*  @code
* pdv_multibuf(pdv_p, 4) ;
*  @endcode
*  -# Data acquisition calls, such as #pdv_image (which acquires an image and returns a pointer to it),
* as in:
* @code
* unsigned char *image = pdv_image(pdv_p) ;
* @endcode
*  -# A call to #pdv_close to close the device before ending the program, as in:
*  @code
* pdv_close(pdv_p) ;
*  @endcode
*  -# Appropriate settings in your makefile or C workspace to compile and link
*  the library files.
*  -# On Linux systems, the \e -lpdv and \e -ledt option to the compiler, to
*  link the library file \e libpdv.so with your program.
*  -# On Linux systems, the \e -L and \e -R options to specify where to find the
*  dynamic libraries at link- and runtime respectively. (See the makefile
*  provided for examples.)
*  -# On Linux systems, the \e -mt option to the compiler (because the library
*  uses multithreading), and the \e -lm option to the compiler (because it uses
*  the math library).
*
* To compile the library as a shared (.so) library on Linux, the following steps are necessary:
* -# run
* @code
* make clean
* @endcode
* -# add
* @code
* -fPIC
* @endcode
* to the ALL_CFLAGS macro in the makefile
* -# switch the library macro in the makefile:
* @code
* LIBRARY=$(PDVLIB)
* @endcode
*  
* See the Makefile (Linux) or generic.mk (Windows), and example programs provided in the
* install directory for examples of compiling code using the digital imaging library routines.
* On Windows you can also create a Visual Studio project to compile and link EDT libraries.
*
* Suggested starting points for acquisition are the <b><em>simple_take.c</em></b>, <em>simplest_take.c</em></b> and other
* <b><em>simple_*.c</em></b> example programs. For serial communication, see <b><em>serial_cmd.c</em></b>, a command line
* serial utility. Other <b><em>simple_*.c</em></b> example programs are provided to show specialized
* functionality.
*
* The  #PdvDev device status structure is defined in the file libpdv.h. It
* includes the #PdvDependent substructure, and other structure elements that describe
* the state of the board and camera, as initialized by the current camera configuration file
* (see the Camera Configuration Guide, at
* <a href="http://www.edt.com/manuals/PDV/camconfig.pdf">www.edt.com/manuals/PDV/camconfig.pdf </A>)
* or modified by any subsequent API setup calls.  These structure elements include values for
* things such as the current pixel re-order or color interpolation method, size and depth
* of the image, number and size of currently allocated buffers.  To ensure compatibility with future
* versions of the library, programmers should always use the library calls for getting / setting any
* library values, and refrain from referencing the structure elements directly. Additionally, anything
* that can be queried via the subroutine calls such as currently set image width, height and depth should be
* done via subroutine calls rather than hard-coding specific values.
*
* The PCI DV library source files are included in the installation. Most but not
* all routines are documented here.  Undocumented routines include internals, custom,
* special purpose and obsoletes.  Feel free, however, to look through the library
* source code and use (with caution) any routines that are appropriate.  Email
* tech@edt.com if you have questions about specific routines.
*
* @note When acquiring images in multithreaded applications, all routines that
* deal with starting, waiting for, or aborting images or buffers should be in
* the same thread.
*
* Routines are divided into the following modules. You can use the Search button
* at the top of this page (in the HTML version of this doc) to search for specific
* library routines.

/** 
* @defgroup acquisition Acquisition
* @ingroup dv
* Image acquisition subroutines.
* The simplest way to acquire an image from an EDT digital imaging board is to use
* #pdv_image (see \e simplest_take.c for an example).
*
* Using #pdv_start_image / #pdv_wait_image splits image acquisition into \e queue and
* \e retrieve phases, allowing programmers to parallelize image acquisition and
* processing (see \e \b simple_take.c).
*
* Using #pdv_start_images with #pdv_wait_images (or #pdv_wait_image) adds prestart /
* queuing for further optimization.  Other subroutines are provided for more
* specialized uses (see other <b><em>simple_*.c</em></b> example programs).
*
* Image acquisition subroutines such as #pdv_wait_image return the data as a
* pointer to the image buffer. Images are not framed in any way, the buffer only
* contains the pixel data. Application programs should use query routines such
* as #pdv_get_width, #pdv_get_height and #pdv_get_depth to find out the data line
* or frame size and number of bits per pixel.
*
* The bitwise format of the pixel data will depend on the number of bits per
* pixel as defined by the camera and configuration file, as well as any
* data deinterleave or demosaicing method (e.g. bayer interpolation) that may be
* enabled via the config file's \b method_interlace directive (exception: \b _raw
* subroutines bypass data re-ordering).  Pixel data for typical formats and
* re-ordering methods are as follows:
*
* <table>
* <tr><td><b>Camera Output</b></td><td><b>Config Attributes (also see the <a href="http://www.edt.com/manuals/PDV/camconfig.pdf">Camera Configuration guide</A>)</b></td><td><b>Buffer data</b></td></tr>
* <tr><td>Monochrome 8 bits</td><td>depth: 8<br>extdepth: 8<br>cl_data_path_norm: 07 (single ch.) or 17 (dual ch.)</td><td>1 byte/pixel<br></td></tr>

/** 
* @defgroup serial Communications/Control 
* @ingroup dv
*
* Serial communications and camera control subroutines.
* Subroutines in this section of the library fall into three general
* categories: 1) low level serial communications and control, 2) framing
* commands for cameras that have sophisticated command framing protocols,
* and 3) high level convenience routines for specific operations on selected
* cameras.
*
* These subroutines are used to communicate with cameras that have a serial
* command set.  Since there is (to date) no standard command set, programmers
* who wish to embed camera control commands within applications will need to
* write code that is specific to the camera(s) in use.
*
* Serial control typically consists a command/response sequence, and looks like
* the following:
*
* @code
* pdv_serial_command(pdv_p, command_string); // ASCII; for binary use pdv_serial_binary_command
* n = pdv_serial_wait(pdv_p, timeout, nchars);
* pdv_serial_read(pdv_p, response_string, n); 
* @endcode
*
* The above is the most general purpose method, but it can be slow since
* pdv_serial_wait will only return after the timeout period expires, in order to ensure
* that all of the response characters have come in. If the last character of a response
* is known and can be assured to always be unique within that response, then the use of
* a <em>serial wait</em> character can be used. When set, it causes #pdv_serial_wait to
* return immediately when the character is seen, without waiting for the full timeout period
* to expire:
*
* @code
* pdv_set_waitchar(pdv_p, '\n');    // only needs to be set once
* pdv_serial_command(pdv_p, command_string);
* n = pdv_serial_wait(pdv_p, timeout, nchars); // still use max timeout in case of failure
* pdv_serial_read(pdv_p, response_string, n);
* @endcode
*
* @note When this library was originally developed, there were a relatively small
* number of cameras and camera command sets to deal with. Consequently, subroutines
* written to directly control specific camera parameters such as #pdv_set_exposure,
* #pdv_set_gain and #pdv_set_blacklevel were coded to handle those tasks for the
* majority of cameras that had such functionality. With the proliferation of cameras
* and command sets over the years, these "convenience routines" have become
* less useful. They remain helpful for cameras whose command sets conform to the
* relatively narrow format defined by the \b serial_exposure, \b serial_gain and
* \b serial_offset config directives, but even then such control is limited, so for
* full control of cameras it is usually necessary for programmers to code such control with the lower-level subroutines
* #pdv_serial_command, #pdv_serial_binary_command, #pdv_serial_wait and
* #pdv_serial_read (or specialized framing commands such as
* #pdv_send_basler_frame).  One important exception is if the camera and board
* are to be set up for <em>pulse-width</em>, aka <em>level trigger</em> acquisition
* control (where the length of the board's shutter timer is used to control the length
* of the EXPOSE pulse and consequently the camera's integration time). When using that mode (ebabled via the method_camera_shutter_timing configuration directive),
* #pdv_set_exposure <em>should</em> be used, since it also controls the board's
* expose timer.

/** 
* @defgroup utility Utility 
* @ingroup dv
* Various utility subroutines.
* Most pci dv utility routines have a \c dvu_ prefix. \c dvu_ subroutines are not necessarily
* specific to the EDT digital imaging hardware. For example, dvu_write_rasfile could concievably
* be used to write a raster file from any source, not just one captured by an EDT PCI DV board.
* As such, \c dvu_ subroutines do not operate on an #PdvDev device handle in their
* parameter lists.
*
* There are a few utility subroutines that don't take a #PdvDev device handle but do have
* a \c pdv_ prefix, and may or may not have some PCI DV specificity.
* 
* The remaining \c pdv_ subroutines that do take a #PdvDev device handle are tagged
* as utility subroutines because they do not fit any other category.

/**
* Returns the number of times the PCI DV timed out (frame didn't transfer 
* completely or at all) since the device was opened.
*
* Timeouts occur when some or all of the image failed to transfer. Reasons for this
* range from an unplugged cable to misconfiguration to system bandwidth saturation.
* If broken images, slow frame rates or blank images are encountered, it will usually
* be associated with an image timeout.
*
* Frequent timeouts can be a result of the board being in a non-optimal bus slot
* or other system-related issues. This is especially true with legacy PCI devices
* such as the PCI DV C-Link. For more information on optimizing your configuration
* (and system requirements in general) see EDT's
* <a href="http://www.edt.com/requirements.html"> System Requirements web page</a>.
*
* A robust application will check to see whether the timeout counter has increased
* after every new acquire, and take appropriate action. Since timeouts are often
* associated with data overruns or underruns, they frequently indicate an out-of-synch
* condtion. So for continuous captures, applications should perform a reset and
* restart following detection of a timeout, by calling #pdv_timeout_restart.
*
* Various factors can prevent timeouts from being reported when data is dropped.
* With some versions of board firmware, if a small amount of data is lost on a line,
* the board's region-of-interest (ROI) logic will fill in the missing data using
* blanking between lines, preventing a timeout from occurring (but still resulting in
* an out-of-synch frame.) This situation can usually be rectified by updating the board
* firmware, since the new versions (e.g. PCIe board FW versions 14 and later) have the
* blanking feature disabled by default.
*
* Hardware continuous mode (enabled via #pdv_start_hardware_continuous or the fv_once
* or hardware_continuous config file directives) can be problmatic for timeouts.
* Since these modes cause the board to ignore all FVAL (frame start) signals beyond
* the first one in a continuous sequence, losses of relatively small amounts of
* data won't trigger a timeout, resulting in a persistently out-of-synch condition.
* The framesync header logic shown in the \b simple_irig2.c example
* application was designed as a workaround for this, and more recently (e.g. driver/library
* versions 5.3.9.4 and later) the framesync logic was incorporated into pdv_timeouts,
* providing a convenient and transparent way to ensure detection of and recovery from 
* an out-of-synch condition without the need to change any code. See  #pdv_enable_framesync
* and the the \b method_framesync directive in the <a href="http://www.edt.com/manuals/PDV/camconfig.pdf">Camera Configuration Guide</A>

* Sets a reasonable image timeout value based on image size and exposure
* time (if set) and pixel clock speed (also if set).
*
* \note This subroutine is called by #pdv_initcam so it generally isn't
* necessary to call it from a user application. Nevertheless it can
* be useful to know how initcam sets the default timeout value (and how
* to override it); hence this description.
* \note
* #pdv_initcam calls this subroutine after reading in the various camera
* parameters from the config file. Since most configs don't (presently)
* have a \b pclock_speed directive specified, it assumes a conservative 5
* Mhz pixel clock speed, which can make for a long timeout value. As a
* result, for faster cameras in general, and large format ones specifically,
* if data loss occurs for whatever reason, the \e pdv_wait acquisition routines
* may block for an excessively long time if data loss occurs. To get around
* this, either add a \b pclock_speed directive to the config file (preferred),
* or set your own fixed timeout override with the \b user_timeout directive
* or #pdv_set_timeout.
* 
* @see pdv_initcam,  pdv_set_timeout, pdv_set_exposure, \b pclock_speed & \b user_timeout directive in the <a href="http://www.edt.com/manuals/PDV/camconfig.pdf">Camera Configuration Guide</A>

* the \b serial_binning camera configuration directive for any camera that

*
* This subroutine was an attempt to provide a way to set binning in a
* generic way, handling a few specific cameras via special code and others
* using an assumed serial format. As it turned out, the "assumed" format is not
* all that standard, therefore this subroutine is of limited usefulness.

* If your camera is one that takes a single ASCII command / argument to set a
* binning mode, then this subroutine may still be handy since it can be a single-
* call method for setting the camera and the board in a given binning mode.
* 
* To use this method, simply set the \b serial_binning camera configuration
* directive to the command that sets binning. Then when called, this subroutine
* will send the command and reset the board's camera size. 
* 
* If your camera does not fit any of the above formats (or if you would rather
* not depend on this flakey logic), simply use #pdv_serial_command or
* #pdv_serial_binary_command to send the command to put the camera into binned
* mode, then call #pdv_setsize to reset the board to the new frame size.
*
* If the PCI DV library does not know how to set binning on the camera in use,
* a -1 will be returned and the width/height/imagesize will remain unchanged.
